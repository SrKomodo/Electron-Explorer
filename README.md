# Electron-Explorer
A file manager built with Electron for extra customization

## Installing (development)
You must have node and npm installed, then just download the repo. Then go to the app folder and open a console there.

Now just use `npm install` to install all dependencies.

Then whenever you want to run it use `npm start`
